# Toolchain Scripts

This folder houses scripts aiding with compilation or dissasembly.

## GTAdhocCompare
Takes two input scripts (compiled form `.adc` or dissasembly `.ad.diss`) and compares the outputs together for matching.


## AdhocToolchainGUI
GUI wrapper for Adhoc Toolchain. User can create a list of 'speed dial' buttons to build particular projects quickly and save the configuration for later use.
It also has tabs for one-off style .yaml builds, singular .ad builds, and disassembly of .adc scripts.
